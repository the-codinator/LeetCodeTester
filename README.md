# LeetCodeTester

A Java Testing Suite for [LeetCode][leetcode] syntax built over [JUnit 5][junit5] and [AssertJ][assertj].

Uses [Lombok][lombok] for some boilerplate,
[Jackson][jackson] for Json parsing,
[Apache commons lang3][lang3] for reflection utilities,
and [Slf4J][slf4j] as the logging adapter.

## Usage

Refer to [DOCS.md](./DOCS.md)

## Disclaimer

I am in no way affiliated to LeetCode. I do not have anything to do with <leetcode.com>.
For all means and purposes, this is an independent project from LeetCode.
This project is just an easy utility to write tests for code using input / output syntax similar to that of LeetCode.
Improvement ideas are welcome.

PS: If LeetCode ends up using this project, it'd be quite interesting :D
